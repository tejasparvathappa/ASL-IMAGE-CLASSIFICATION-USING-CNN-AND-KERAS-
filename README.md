# ASL-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN-AND-KERAS- 100% Accuracy
The plan calls for the creation of a system that can translate American Sign Language into basic English alphabets. This approach will determine the alphabets that people establish in ASL terminology, which will then be translated into English alphabets. This will bridge the gap between ASL users and those who are unfamiliar with the language, allowing them to communicate comfortably using Image Processing techniques implementing CNN and Keras.
